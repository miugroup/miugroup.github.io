The Miu Group will be generally interested in exploring the electrochemical sensitivity of reactive systems.
With a particular interest in the cross section of electrochemistry and biology---from proteins, through cells, to devices---we will aim to interrogate and engineer molecular mechanisms that allow us to program biological activity through the delivery of electrochemical signals.
Through a multi-scale approach, we focus on enabling microbes and biomolecules as electroactive materials for a sustainable and equitable future in industry, therapeutics, and resource conservation.

### Engineering Protein Electrochemistry

#### *By tuning protein electrochemistry, we can build molecular links between electrodes and cells*

Our first research direction aims to engineer the electrochemical properties of proteins.
These bio-macromolecules perform catalytic reactions central to metabolism, help maintain cell health, enable cell-to-cell communication, movement, and more.
Proteins are fundamental to cellular identity, highlighted by the fact that protein engineering has long been pursued as a means to intentionally tune cell behavior.
Here, we will modify the standard reduction potentials of proteins so that we can intentionally alter their state with an electrode.
Through intentional and specific mutations, we can design and define the potential at which a protein's function can be turned on and off.
This potential dependence---or, this ***electrochemical sensitivity***---is key to defining molecular connections between electrodes and microbial machinery.

### Programming Gene Expression

#### *By assembling electrochemically sensitive gene circuits, we can ask cells to respond to electrochemical signals*

Building up from the molecular-scale, our second research direction will be concerned with cellular-scale behavior.
The engineering of individual proteins will allow us to directly address gene expression, however, we need to couple the expression of multiple proteins together in order to achieve macroscale functionality.
We will leverage electrochemically-inducible promoters and the tools of electrogenetics to control gene expression with an electrode.
By using several transcriptional units together, we can build genetic circuits that allow us to manipulate cells and give them new abilities.
Our efforts at this cellular level aim to engineer ***electrode-dependent cell behavior***, which enables the interconversion of electrochemical signals and microbial action.

### Electrifying Reactive Bio-Systems

#### *By injecting renewable electricity, we can drive biocatalysis and metabolism*

Our third direction will pursue the electrification of biological reactions, with the intent of using renewable electricity as an inexpensive and abundant source of energy.
The focus here is on reactor-, device-, and process-scales.
We will be prototypting and building reactor and flow cell architectures that perform biologically-mediated unit operations.
Electroactive microbes will be used to catalyze chemical transformations, perform material separations, and more.
Here, we will realize instances of ***electronically powered biochemistry*** by tightly integrating abiotic electrochemistry with biocatalysis.
We envision this as a platform which could yield solutions to issues in sustainable synthesis.
