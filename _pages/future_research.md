The Miu Group will be generally interested in exploring the electrochemical sensitivity of reactive systems.
With a particular interest in the cross section of electrochemistry and biology, we will aim to interrogate and engineer the molecular mechanisms that allow us to program cellular behavior through the delivery of electrochemical signals.
We will focus on enabling microbes as electroactive materials for a sustainable and equitable future in industry, therapeutics, and resource conservation.

Much of our interest in electroactive microbes stems from the idea that life is fundamentally electrochemical.
Cells in all living organisms are energized through redox transformations of food molecules.
Neural activity produces thought, emotion, and movement through the buildup of charge separation and transfer of electrical signals.
Life could not exist without electrochemical reactions, and failure to maintain redox balance leads to dysfunction and disease.
This innate electrochemistry offers an opportunity to intentionally modulate intracellular redox state, transmembrane ion transport, metabolic fluxes, and more.
However, we currently have limited means to control intracellular events with an electrode.
By contrast, the last fifty years has seen an explosion of techniques to manipulate abiotic electrochemical systems, such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, and batteries.
What remains to be developed is a set of bioelectrochemical mechanisms that define the electrode-microbe interface.
Research in the Miu Group is organized to address this gap.

##### By tuning protein electrochemistry, we can building molecular links between electrodes and cells

Our first research direction aims to engineer the electrochemical properties of proteins.
These bio-macromolecules perform catalytic reactions central to metabolism, help maintain cell health, enable cell-to-cell communication, movement, and more.
Proteins are fundamental to cellular identity, highlighted by the fact that protein engineering has long been pursued as a means to intentionally tune cell behavior.
Here, we will modify the standard reduction potentials of proteins so that we can intentionally alter their state with an electrode.
Through intentional and specific mutations, we can design and define the potential at which a protein's function can be turned on and off.
This potential dependence---or, this ***electrochemical sensitivity***---is key to defining molecular connections between electrodes and microbial machinery.

#### **Programming Gene Expression** *to Respond to Electrical Signals*

Building up from the molecular-scale, our second research direction will be concerned with cellular-scale behavior.
The engineering of individual proteins will allow us to directly address gene expression, however, we need to couple the expression of multiple proteins together in order to achieve macroscale functionality.
We will leverage electrochemically-inducible promoters and the tools of electrogenetics to control gene expression with an electrode.
By using several transcriptional units together, we can build genetic circuits that allow us to manipulate cells and give them new abilities.
Our efforts at this cellular level aim to engineer ***electrode-dependent cell behavior***, which enables the interconversion of electrochemical signals and microbial action.

#### **Electrifying Reactive Bio-Systems** *to Power (A)biotic Cells*

Our third direction will pursue the electrification of biological reactions, with the intent of using renewable electricity as an inexpensive and abundant source of energy.
The focus here is on reactor-, device-, and process-scales.
We will be prototypting and building reactor and flow cell architectures that perform biologically-mediated unit operations.
Electroactive microbes will be used to catalyze chemical transformations, perform material separations, and more.
In addition, proteins and cells that have been engineered in Aims 1 and 2 will be characterized and deployed on the systems developed here.
Our approach will center on the tight integration of abiotic electrochemistry and enzymatic catalysis, to engineer solutions to issues in sustainable synthesis.
