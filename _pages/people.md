Evan completed his B.S. in Chemical Engineering at Bucknell University in 2016.
At Bucknell, he worked in the lab of Katsuyuki Wakabayashi, where he developed high temperature and cryogenic methods of recycling post-consumer polymers.
Evan then joined BASF Corporation's Professional Development Program, a 2-year rotational program.
Through three rotations, he held positions in technical service engineering (Houston, TX), capital project management (Newport, DE), and catalysis R&D (Iselin, NJ).
After BASF, Evan began his PhD at the University of Pittsburgh in August 2018 where he joined the groups of James R. McKone and Giannis Mpourmpakis.
As a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow, he investigated metal oxides as catalytic mediators for hydrogen transfer reactions.
After completing his PhD in June 2023, he joined Karthish Manthiram's group at the California Institute of Technology as a Postdoctoral Scholar Research Associate.
In his Postdoc, Evan is building molecular links between electrodes and bacteria, with a focus on electrochemically regulated gene expression.
Aside from research and teaching, Evan runs, plays soccer, and reminisces about the days he used to play his french horn.
