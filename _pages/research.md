### Overview

The Miu group interrogates and engineers the electrochemical sensitivity of reactive systems.
We pay particular attention to the electrochemisty-biology interface and endeavor to build solutions to issues in sustainability and human health.

## 1. Proteins
Much of the behavior of living cells arises from the activity of proteins.
These bio-macromolecules perform catalytic reactions central to metabolism, help maintain cell health, enable cell-to-cell communication, movement, and more.
With proteins being so fundamental to cellular identity, protein engineering has long been pursued as a means to intentionally tune cell behavior.

Here, we aim to engineer the electrochemical sensitivity of proteins.
In particular, we will tune the standard reduction potentials of proteins so that we can intentionally alter their state with an electrode.
Example targets include iron-sulfur clusters in gene regulators and thiol-disulfide bonds in biomolecular condensates.
In the first example, we envision a paradigm in which electrohcemical signals are used to turn gene expression on and off.
In the second, polarization can be used to instigate post-translational modifications which lead to liquid-liquid separation.

## 2. Cells
Building up from the molecular-scale, we leverage electrochemically-inducible promoters to control gene expression with an electrode.
By coupling several of these units together, we can build genetic circuits that allow us to manipulate the behavior of cells and give them new abilities.
Our efforts at the cellular level aim to engineer *electrode-dependent cell functions*.
