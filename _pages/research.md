My research interests lie at the intersection of experimental electrochemistry, biology, catalysis, and applied mathematics.
Taking a wholly interdisciplinary approach to science, I have found that the synthesis of multiple, competing perspectives often leads to the most compelling solutions to difficult technical problems.
In this spirit, my research makes an intentional effort to unify quantitative theory and modeling with rigorous experimentation.
I have so far pointed this combined approach at issues related to sustainability, as described below.

Works published so far can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lvfsM9wAAAAJ&hl=en) page.
A description of future directions planned for my independent research group can be found on the [Future Research](future-research) tab.
