#### **Overview**
I am broadly interested in the behavior of reactive systems, viewed through the lens of electrochemistry.


Below is a brief description of three areas of research that I pursued during my PhD, as well as a comment on my current postdoctoral work.
A description of future research directions can be found on the [Future Research](future-research) tab.

#### **1. Quantifying the Electrochemical Sensitivity of Metal Oxides**
*Unifying first-principles calculations and macroscale experimental measurements*



#### **2. Graph Theoretical Representations of Structure**
*Accelerating Property Evaluation by Combining Scales of Geometry*

Much of the mathematics developed in my PhD that describe the standard reduction potentials of metal oxides will be translated to describe the standard reduction potentials of proteins.
Although strong similarities remain, there are interesting differences that will provide rich areas of development.
For example, the global connectivity is currently build on *atom-to-atom* interactions.
Due to the size of proteins, we expect to recast the definition of global and local connectivities to consider *residue-to-residue* interactions.

#### **3. Electrochemical Process Engineering**
*Designing Systems to Integrate a Electrochemical Activation with a Thermochemical Reaction*
